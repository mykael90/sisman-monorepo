# Product Context
## Why This Project Exists
Brazilian Federal Educational Institutions (IFES) face challenges in maintenance management due to:
- Reliance on manual processes and spreadsheets
- Inadequate existing systems
- Lack of standardized data
- Difficulties in strategic planning
- Underutilization/premature degradation of assets

Commercial CMMS solutions present issues with:
- Cost
- Interoperability with public administration systems
- Data ownership
- Customization to IFES-specific needs

This project aims to develop an open-source, web-based CMMS prototype tailored for IFES to:
- Improve maintenance operation efficiency
- Enhance data quality for decision-making

## How It Should Work
The system will provide:
1. **Asset Management:**
   - Inventory of infrastructure assets
   - Categorization and basic information
2. **Work Order Management:**
   - Creation, assignment, tracking, and closure
   - Prioritization mechanism
3. **User & Role Management:**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Different access levels (admins, managers, technicians)
4. **Materials Management:**
   - Tracking of materials consumed
   - Basic inventory management
5. **Reporting:**
   - Basic reports on work orders and maintenance history
6. **Data Input & Retrieval:**
   - Forms for new assets/work orders
   - Search and filter capabilities

## Key Stakeholders
- **Primary:** Maintenance departments/managers at IFES (initially UFRN's DIMAN/INFRA)
- **Secondary:** 
  - Technicians
  - Administrative staff
  - Facility users (for reporting issues)

## Success Metrics
1. **Functional prototype delivery:** MVP addressing core maintenance needs
2. **Efficiency improvement:** Reduced operational inefficiencies at UFRN
3. **Data quality enhancement:** Structured, reliable data on maintenance activities
4. **Solution validation:** Positive feedback from UFRN personnel
5. **Decision-making support:** Ability to provide data for operational/tactical decisions
