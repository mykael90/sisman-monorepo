# Progress
## What Works
- **Backend Foundation:**
  - NestJS application scaffolded
  - Prisma ORM configured with MariaDB connection
  - Basic modules created (users, materials, maintenance)
  - Winston logger implemented
- **Frontend Foundation:**
  - Next.js application with App Router
  - Tailwind CSS configured
  - Basic layout components
  - Authentication context setup
- **Shared Infrastructure:**
  - Prisma schema defined
  - TypeScript types package
  - Monorepo build system with pnpm

## What's Left to Build
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Complete asset management implementation
  - Work order creation and tracking
  - Material consumption tracking
  - Reporting module
- **Authentication:**
  - Full JWT authentication flow
  - Role-based access control
- **Testing:**
  - Frontend testing setup
  - End-to-end testing
- **Deployment:**
  - Production deployment pipeline
  - CI/CD configuration

## Current Status
- Project in early development phase
- Backend API endpoints partially implemented
- Frontend UI components scaffolded but not connected to backend
- Basic database schema defined via Prisma

## Known Issues
1. Authentication flow not fully implemented
2. Missing error handling in API routes
3. Frontend state management needs refinement
4. Database schema requires validation rules

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Switched from SQLite to MariaDB for production readiness
2. Adopted TanStack libraries instead of Redux for state management
3. Implemented monorepo structure for better code sharing
4. Chose Winston over built-in NestJS logger for flexibility
