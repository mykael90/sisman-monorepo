# Active Context
## Current Work Focus
Completing memory bank initialization and documentation for the SISMAN project.

## Recent Changes
1. Created and populated core memory bank files:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - techContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - progress.md
2. Established documentation hierarchy and relationships
3. Defined key technical patterns and architecture

## Next Steps
1. Review memory bank files for accuracy and completeness
2. Begin development on authentication module (JWT implementation)
3. Connect frontend to backend API endpoints
4. Implement role-based access control

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using NextAuth.js for frontend authentication
- Implementing NestJS Passport JWT strategy for backend
- Considering Zod for schema validation

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Strict TypeScript typing throughout
- Consistent directory structure across apps
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Monorepo structure improves code sharing but adds complexity
- Prisma ORM simplifies database interactions
- TanStack libraries provide efficient state management
- Well-documented codebase accelerates onboarding
